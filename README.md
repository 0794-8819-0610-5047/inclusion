# Open Innovation - Diversity & Inclusion

Welcome to Diversity & Inclusion at Mozilla! We welcome all contributors and are eager to work with you, but due to the highly confidential nature of much of our work, we currently only have occasional tasks available for non-staff contributors. 

All of the information of our externally facing work, links, and resources can be [found on our wiki here](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Diversity_and_Inclusion_for_Communities_and_Contributors). Please do join our [D&I in Open Source Mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/diversity--inclusion-in-open-source) to connect with our team, and others across the open source ecosystem working on inclusion!
