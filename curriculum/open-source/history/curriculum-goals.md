#Curriculum 

### What are we building?
A compliment, or companion module for any course/content teaching 'the history of open source. Some examples I can find are (please add yours so we can reach out to those authors):

* http://teachingopensource.org/foss-category/foss-history/?post_types=learning_material,post_tag,tag
* https://emmairwin.github.io/learning-open-source/articles/open-is-an-attitude/history-of-open/

### Why are we building it?

The history of open source, is primarily described as a history of actions and decisions by people related specifically to technology.
Culture, diversity, inclusion and equity are usually seperate, and yet the state of these, throughout history -  permitted, elevate and allowed sustained succes, and often unchecked priveldge to certain people and groups; in parallel,  participation and voices of those not enabled, deterred or forced out were muted, or invisible.

We are building this module, as an addon for existing content, to ensure that everyone just stepping into Open Source, has this bigger picture of history, and for benefit of the future. 

### Who is our audience?

* Students (higher education)
* Developers (already in their technology careers)

### How do we ensure quality?

### What format will this content be written in?
