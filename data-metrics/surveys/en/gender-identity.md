This standard is based on the following research:
*  **D&I in Open Source Survey** : Providing a long list of gender-spectrum questions (from [Open Demographics](https://drnikki.github.io/sphinx-ghpages/index.html)) resulted in the selection of at least one of each.  Some respondents also indicated that desire for multiple choice options.  Low participation from regions like Asia and Africa may have been linked to the less-traditional, and familiar list of genders.
* **India Groups survey:** In India gender choice for government forms is Male, Female and Third Gender, which makes room for another gender without specifically identifying.  We added Other_____ to our forms to accomodate what we know about self identification.

Based on these and other findings, the current standard is to provide multiple choice, and an option to self-identify. The only limitation of which is that you cannot identify multiple 'Others'.

To which gender identity to you most identify? (multiple choice)

- [ ]  Male
- [ ]  Female
- [ ]  Other ___________
