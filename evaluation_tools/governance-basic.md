# Open Source Inclusion Basic Checklist


This checklist provides open source projects with basics for evaluating the inclusive design in key areas.  This checklist is intended to provide insight, and education.

## Governance

### Code of Conduct

- [ ] We have a Code of Conduct ("CoC").
- [ ] Our Code of Conduct is visible from our main project page and/or repository root and linked from all communication channels.
- [ ] It is clearly stated in the COC how to report behaviors at that are illegal or make individuals/groups feel unsafe, unwelcome or uncomfortable .
- [ ] It is clear to whom that report will go.  This means names of people, and their individual email addresses.
- [ ] There is an option to reach out to only one of those people.
- [ ] We have a process for responding to reports.

## Leadership
These are based on [CHAOSS working group criteria for inclusive leadership](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/blob/master/assets/leadership-principles.md).

- [ ] Our project leadership is designed with cycles of feedback and review to avoid gatekeeping and to encourage inclusive behavior.
- [ ] Responsiblities of leadership are clearly documented.
- [ ] Our project leadership 'leads by example' - expected behaviors outlined in our CoC.
- [ ] We recognize leadership equally, including non-technical leadership.

## Project & Community Design

- [ ] We have a welcoming and open channel for community particpiation.
- [ ] We strive to avoid [jargon and other non-inclusive language](https://open.buffer.com/inclusive-language-tech/) that can alienate, and make underrepresented people feel excluded.

### Language & Documentation

- [ ] We recognize that the the primary language of the project may not be the first language of all contributors, and where possible provide transcripts of meetings and other key project correspondence are easily found.
- [ ] We taken one or more steps to improve the [accessiblity](https://www.comprend.com/blog/2017/test-your-websites-accessibility/) of your documentation/website?
