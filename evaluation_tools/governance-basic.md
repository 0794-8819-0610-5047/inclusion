# Governance

#### Work in Progress

This checklist provides open source projects with basics for evaluating the inclusive design in key areas.  This checklist is intended 
to provide insight, and education and is not intended to be critical of progress.

More advanced evaluation tactics can be found here(TBD)

## Governance

### Code of Conduct

- [ ] We have a Code of Conduct ("CoC").
- [ ] Our Code of Conduct is visible from our main project page and/or repository.
- [ ] It is clear how to report violations of our CoC.  For example, a [REPORTING.MD](https://github.com/mozilla/repo-templates/blob/master/templates/REPORTING.md) file.
- [ ]  We understand how to effectively enforce our CoC.

## Leadership
These are based on [CHAOSS working group criteria for inclusive leadership](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-diversity-inclusion/blob/master/assets/leadership-principles.md).

- [ ] Our project leadership is provided with cycles of feedback and review to avoid gatekeeping.
- [ ]  Responsiblities of leadership is clearly documented.
- [ ] Our leaders 'lead by example' of expected behaviors outlined in our CoC.
- [ ]  We recognize leadership equally, including non-technical leadership.

## Project Design

### Language

- [ ] We are mindful of being inclusive in our language, and documentation. (resource link to non inclusive words)
