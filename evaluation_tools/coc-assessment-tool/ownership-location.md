As a very first step in reviewing a project Code of Conduct, ensure that it is:


* In the root of a repository
* And/or available from the main website.

## Encouraged
* Located in the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.MD FILE
* **Linked from README.md** , CONTRIBUTING.md and other first-contact places & spaces.

## Discouraged
* Embedded in a README.md or other file with participation/technical onboarding.  

## Red flags
* Links to templates without modification. For example:  'We have adopted the Contributor Convenant' (linked out), provides no contact information for reporting.
