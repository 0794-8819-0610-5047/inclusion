# Contributor Testing Steps
This is a small script that we adapt each time, to each project to allow us to do 'user testing' aka 'contributor testing' on a project.  Participants must not be familiar with the project, code or community, although they should be confident with the technology.

## Actions (5 minutes)

1. Open Your browser, and navigate to the project main page (provide this link).
2. Learn about this tool, project, initiative (5 minutes)

## Questions

1. What did you learn?
2. Do you have questions still, of so what are they?

## Getting Started Actions ( 15 minutes)

1. Find and follow the 'getting started' information to setup an initial instance, copy or version of the project.

## Questions
Even if you didn't finish...

1. How did that go?
2. What was well documented?  What could have been improved and why?

## Community Actions ( 15 minutes)

1. Find the Code of Conduct.
2. Find information on the community leaders and staff.
3. Log into the chat channel and say hi.
4. Review the contributing document (CONTRIBUTING.md usually, but sometimes the README.md)

## Questions

1. How did that go?
2. What did you observec about the community channel?
3. If you found information on the community leaders/staff how did that information make you feel more or less likely to conribute?
4. Based on the contributing document, do you feel about contributing?  What would you attempt first?

## Environment (Remaining Time)

1. Complete the environment build steps, use the community channel to ask for help if you're stuck, or have questions.
